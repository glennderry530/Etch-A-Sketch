Here is my first pass at the Etch a Sketch. I took my time and really slowed down in order to get my head wrapped around event handling and arrow functions.  Its fairly responsive ish and should work at any size device.  I tried to enable touch functionality, but I'm not sure if it works on everything.
 
Still to do. 
 --add Toggle switch for grid line visibility
 --Layering System
 --Save and recall
 --export your image somehow
 --redo Layout and graphics or make a couple themes for it
